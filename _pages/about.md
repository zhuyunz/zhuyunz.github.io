Hello! I am a final-year PhD candidate and NASA FINESST Fellow at [Caltech Astronomy](https://www.astro.caltech.edu/). 

My primary research focuses on the formation and evolution of galaxies. I work with my advisors [Chuck Steidel](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~ccs/) and [Evan Kirby](https://galacticarchaeology.nd.edu/people/evan-kirby/) to characterize the stellar populations and interstellar medium in galaxies at various redshifts. As an enthusiast of spectroscopy, I primarily use multi-slit and integral field spectrographs on the [Keck telescopes](https://www.keckobservatory.org) and the [Palomar 200-inch telescope](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/hale.html) to measure the elemental abundances of galaxies, aiming to understand the physical processes driving the chemical evolution of galaxies.  


Before coming to Caltech, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Astronomy from [Nanjing University](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/). I was born and raised in Shenzhen, a beautiful coastal city in Southern China. 

You can find a full list of my publications on NASA ADS [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0002-1945-2299&sort=date+desc).
