Hello! I am a CIERA Postdoctoral Fellow at Northwestern University, where I study how galaxies form, grow, and evolve over billions of years. I study the stellar populations and interstellar medium of galaxies at a range of redshifts using multi-slit and integral field spectroscopy. By measuring the abundances of key elements such as magnesium, iron, and oxygen, I aim to uncover the physical processes that drive chemical enrichment and link a galaxy’s past star formation to its present-day properties.

Before joining CIERA, I earned my PhD in Astrophysics from Caltech, where I worked with Chuck Steidel and Evan Kirby. I completed my B.Sc. in Astronomy at Nanjing University.

You can find a full list of my publications on ADS [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0002-1945-2299&sort=date+desc).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
